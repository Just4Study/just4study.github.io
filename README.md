Made Based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) And [here](https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon).

**If you like this project, PLEASE give it a star.**

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

All the configurations are inside either `_config.yml` or `_config.scss`. The options are fairly straightforward. 

The theme supports: 

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color
2. Changable sidebar locations
3. Integration of FontAwesome, MathJax, Disqus and Google Analytics
4. and numerous improvements over original Lanyon
